International Klein Blue (IKB) is a deep blue hue first mixed by the French artist Yves Klein. IKB's visual impact comes from its heavy reliance on ultramarine, as well as Klein's often thick and textured application of paint to canvas.

Unfortunately, due to the unique composition of our planet's atmosphere, the blue wavelengths normally solely reflected by the pigments are instead absorbed.

The only light reflected is the red wavelength. IKB being an experimental conceptual art piece, one can assume that its transformation causes no loss to the message of the artist."
