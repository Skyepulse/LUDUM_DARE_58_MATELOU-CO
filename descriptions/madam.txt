Michael Angelo Parker, a US American artist of Mexican descent, painted The Creation of Madam during his incarceration in Alligator Alcatraz in 2034. 

Parker lived in troubled times, following the revelation that the President of the USA was actually a lizard from outer space bent on destroying human's coordinated efforts to reach the stars. 

After his liberation in 2040, Parker devoted his life to fairness and human rights. His death in 2040 came as a shock to no one, certainly not himself, and his art pieces were forgotten for a long time.

This piece, depicting the Creator giving Their blessing to a transgender woman, represents the hope of the artist for an acceptance of all people, no matter our differences.
