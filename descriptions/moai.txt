Moai or mo ªai are monolithic human figures carved by the Rapa Nui people on Rapa Nui (Easter Island) in eastern Polynesia between the years 1250 and 1500.
//
Nearly half are still on Rapa Nui, but multiple have been transported to terraformed planets around the human world.
//
Almost all moai have overly large heads, which account for three-eighths of the size of the whole statue. They also have no legs. The moai are chiefly the living faces (aringa ora) of deified ancestors (aringa ora ata tepuna).

This statue was acquired fair and square, despite what the government of the Unified Southern Americas may say.
